Common functionality that many users need are often made into a core plugin. They are created and maintained by us and come bundled with the viewer code. As a result they are available directly via the `RV.Plugins` object and can be used without importing any additional files. Since these types of plugins increase the overall viewer code size, we restrict the number and size of these plugins. Any plugins that don't make it into `core` become [[External Plugins]].
